# Coffee Journal

A personal journal for tracking coffee tastings, brew recipes, roast notes, and café visits.

## Features (starter ideas)
- Log tasting notes: origin, roast date, aroma, flavor notes, acidity, body, aftertaste
- Save brew recipes: brewer, dose, grind, water, time, yield
- Track roasters and cafes
- Export entries to CSV/Markdown
- Simple web UI or static site for browsing entries

## Getting started
1. Create the repository (see instructions in the repo creation commands).
2. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GlennRC/coffee-journal.git
   cd coffee-journal
   ```
3. Add entries in `entries/` as Markdown files, or implement a small app in `src/`.

## Suggested structure
- entries/            - Markdown files with tasting notes
- src/                - web app / scripts
- docs/               - documentation
- data/               - export/import helpers
